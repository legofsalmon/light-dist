# Resolume & MIDI integration

Wiring Arena's clip grid and a MIDI controller into LIGHT.

## Resolume Arena over OSC

LIGHT listens for OSC on UDP port **7700** by default (change it in **Sync · MIDI**).

### One-time Arena setup

1. Arena ▸ **Preferences ▸ OSC**.
2. Enable **OSC Output**.
3. Output address: `127.0.0.1` (same machine), port: **7700**.

That's all. With **follow columns** and **bpm from resolume** enabled in LIGHT's Sync tab (both default on):

- **Launching an Arena column fires the matching LIGHT column** as a cue — Arena column 3 fires LIGHT column 3. Keep the two grids arranged in parallel and one button runs video and lights together. (Arena emits the column connect for mouse launches too, so this catches everything.)
- **Arena's BPM drives every LIGHT effect.** Arena sends its tempo slider normalised 0–1 over its 20–500 BPM range; LIGHT converts back automatically. Arena's *resync* also snaps LIGHT's downbeat.

### Addresses LIGHT understands

| Address | Args | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `/composition/columns/N/connect` | int ≥ 1 (or none) | Fire column N (1-based) |
| `/composition/tempocontroller/tempo` | float 0–1 (or raw BPM > 1) | Set BPM |
| `/composition/tempocontroller/resync` | — | Snap phase to downbeat |
| `/light/bpm` | float | Set BPM directly |
| `/light/column` | int (1-based) | Fire a column |
| `/light/blackout` | 0 / 1 | Blackout off / on |

The `/light/*` addresses are for anything else that speaks OSC — TouchOSC layouts, QLab, custom scripts.

Messages from another machine — a TouchOSC phone, a second Mac — are blocked until **Sync · MIDI → other machines** is set to *accepted*. Blocked, only this Mac's own programs are heard (the Arena setup above sends to 127.0.0.1, so it is unaffected); the monitor still shows the message, marked ignored. The setting is saved on this Mac, not in the show.

### Debugging

The **OSC monitor** (Sync tab) shows the last messages received live. If nothing appears: check Arena's OSC output is enabled and pointed at the right port, and that LIGHT's listener is on (the OSC status dot in the top bar lights while messages arrive). If the line appears marked *ignored — other machines are blocked*, it came from another machine — see *other machines* above.

### LIGHT sending OSC (messages out)

LIGHT can tell one other machine what it is doing. Set its address and port under **Sync · MIDI → messages out** (empty = off; the setting is part of the show). LIGHT then sends:

| Address | Args | When |
|---|---|---|
| `/light/column` | int (1-based) | a column fired — from a pad, a MIDI note, Arena, or an incoming `/light/column` |
| `/light/tap` | int 1 | the tap button |
| `/light/allstop` | int 1 | the panic (everything dark and cleared) |
| `/light/bpm` | float | the tempo changed (at most four times a second) |
| `/light/blackout` | int 0 / 1 | blackout went off / on |

A freshly set destination is sent the current tempo and blackout at once, so a follower configured mid-show starts in step. Plain OSC 1.0 messages over UDP, no bundles — a Companion, QLab, a TouchOSC layout or a script can follow them. LIGHT never sends to its own listener (the same machine and the port under *Resolume link*), so a message cannot fire the column that produced it.

**grandMA3.** The console's OSC input only understands its own addresses (`/[prefix]/Page1/Fader201`, `/[prefix]/cmd` with a command-line string), so it cannot follow `/light/*` directly; a small bridge (Companion, a Lua plugin, a script) that turns `/light/column N` into `/[prefix]/cmd "Go+ Sequence N"` is the way round, and the shapes of the `/light/*` messages above are fixed so such a bridge stays simple. The other direction needs nothing: a cue or macro on the MA can `SendOSC` `/light/column 3`, `/light/bpm 128` or `/light/blackout 1` to LIGHT's port (7700) once **other machines** is *accepted*.

### Current limits

- Clip-level follows (`/composition/layers/N/clips/M/connect`) aren't mapped yet — columns are the sync unit. Per-clip mapping is on the roadmap.
- Tempo follows Arena's tempo slider. Two other sources can take it instead, both native-engine only: **Ableton Link**, where a local tap or BPM drag is pushed back to the session, and **MIDI beat clock**, where the first input sending clock owns the tempo until it goes quiet. Link and beat clock are one choice, not two, and while the beat clock is following it wins over Arena. Link is not in 1.0.0 builds, pending Ableton's Link licence; there the beat clock and Arena are the choices.

## MIDI

### How learn works

1. Arm **MIDI LEARN** in the top bar.
2. Click the thing to map: a grid cell, a column header, a layer master, the grand master, speed, fade, haze, tap, or blackout.
3. Touch your controller. The **engine** captures the next note or CC and stores the mapping in the project.

Because the engine owns the mapping, it works identically whether the MIDI arrives through the browser (WebMIDI) or natively in the app (CoreMIDI) — and in the app, your controller keeps working even if the window is closed.

### Behaviour

- **Notes** act like fingers: note-on fires the cell (or column/tap/blackout), note-off releases it — so a pad held on a *flash* look behaves exactly like holding the mouse button.
- **CCs** drive continuous targets (masters, speed, fade, haze) with the full 0–127 range. A CC mapped to a button-style target treats > 63 as pressed.
- Mappings are per-project. View and delete them in **Sync · MIDI**.

### Browser vs app

- **Browser (dev)**: Chrome's WebMIDI is used; the page will ask for MIDI permission once. The browser forwards events to the engine.
- **App**: the Rust core talks to CoreMIDI directly and hot-plugs devices (rescan every few seconds). When the engine has native inputs, the UI stops forwarding WebMIDI so a device connected to both paths can't double-trigger.

### Firing pads from a DAW

A MIDI clip in Ableton, Logic or Bitwig can fire pads and columns exactly like a
controller pad, in the next 40 Hz frame. Nothing in LIGHT needs enabling: the
app connects to **every** CoreMIDI input it finds and rescans for new ones, so a
virtual bus is just another controller as far as the mapping is concerned.

**There is nothing to set up.** While the app is running it publishes a MIDI
port of its own called **LIGHT**, so it is already in your DAW's list of MIDI
outputs. Point a track at it, put notes on the track, then in LIGHT arm MIDI
LEARN, click the pad you want, and play the note. That is the whole recipe — the
mapping stores in the project like any other. Beat clock sent to the same port
drives the tempo, and the beat clock button names *LIGHT* as its source.

The port exists only while the app is running, so start LIGHT before you go
looking for it in the DAW. It is a destination, not a source: it appears where
your DAW lists MIDI **outputs**, and LIGHT never lists it among its own inputs
because the console would only be talking to itself.

**If you would rather use an IAC bus** — routing to several apps at once, or
keeping the DAW's output pointed somewhere stable across restarts — that still
works, and it is the only option in a browser session, where LIGHT has no native
MIDI to publish. Open *Audio MIDI Setup* (in Applications ▸ Utilities), choose
*Window ▸ Show MIDI Studio*, and double-click **IAC Driver**. Tick *Device is
online*, and add a bus if there is none. The bus appears to every app on the Mac
as both an input and an output, named for the device and the bus together — "IAC
Driver Bus 1", say. It will show up under *inputs* in LIGHT's **Sync · MIDI**
tab; if it does not, the driver is offline or the bus has not been added.

Two things to know before you build a show on it.

**A pad mapping is a position, not a look.** A mapping points at a layer and a
column, and each song has its own page of pads at those positions. So the same
note fires a different look after a song switch, which is either exactly what
you want (the DAW plays the same arrangement of hits through every song) or a
trap (you wanted *that* look). If you want one note to mean one look, keep it in
one song, or map the song switch to the DAW too and let the two move together.

**There is no timeline lock.** LIGHT reads MIDI beat clock for tempo, and a
transport start lands the downbeat, so a DAW can drive the tempo and the
downbeat (see *Tempo* in the [user guide](user-guide.md)). It does **not** read
song position pointer or MIDI timecode, so starting playback from the middle of
a song gives you the tempo but not the position — nothing chases the timeline.
Notes fire when they arrive and that is all. Locking a show to a timeline is
meant to come through Arena's column follow rather than a direct DAW hook, which
is why the OSC path above is the one with the sequencing in it.

### The APC40 mk2 layout

Load it from **Sync · MIDI** (settings → Sync · MIDI → load a layout). What the
surface does then:

| Control | Does |
|---|---|
| Top 4 grid rows | The four layers, pad for pad with the screen |
| Bottom grid row | Nothing — it is the dial row the grid draws there |
| **CLIP STOP row** (under the grid) | **Fires that column** — CLIP STOP under column 3 is a GO for column 3 |
| Scene launch 1–4 | Clear that layer |
| STOP ALL CLIPS | Blackout |
| TAP TEMPO | Tap |
| **METRONOME** | **SYNC** — now is the top of the bar, for the tempo and for every effect shape |
| Bank ◀ ▶ | Previous / next song |
| Track faders 1–4, 6, 7 | Layer masters, haze, effect speed |
| Master fader | Grand master |
| 8 device knobs | The eight dials, on every track-selection bank |

CLIP STOP reads as *stop* beside Arena, and here it starts a section instead.
That is deliberate: it is one note (52) on eight MIDI channels, one per track,
which is what makes it the only row on the surface that can carry eight cues
without taking the dial row. Its LED lights while the whole column is on stage.

### The busk layout

**APC40 mk2 · busk** is the same layout with the four right-hand track faders
given to groups: pull the strips down under a drop without reaching for the
mouse.

| Control | Does |
|---|---|
| Track faders 1–4 | Layer masters, as in the APC40 mk2 layout |
| Track faders 5–8 | The level of the first four groups on the GROUPS row |
| Haze, effect speed | On screen only — they give up their faders |

Choose the four by pinning them: click **GROUPS** at the head of the group row,
and pin the ones you want in the order you want them. Pinned groups come first
on the row, and the rest follow in the show's order. The faders take the row as
it is when the layout loads, so after changing the pins, load it again.

### Two controllers on one Mac

An APC for LIGHT and an APC for Resolume send the same notes, and LIGHT listens
to every MIDI input it can see — so out of the box the Resolume unit's CLIP STOP
row fires LIGHT's columns and its STOP ALL CLIPS is a blackout. Two things fix
it:

1. macOS names both units "APC40 mk2", and LIGHT can only tell inputs apart by
   name. Open **Audio MIDI Setup**, open one unit, and rename it (say
   `APC40 LIGHT`). Both apps then list the two under their own names.
2. In **Sync · MIDI**, each input is a key: lit while LIGHT listens to it.
   Switch the Resolume unit off. LIGHT ignores what it sends, learn does not
   hear it, and its LEDs are left to Resolume. LIGHT's LED feedback goes to the
   APC that is switched on. The switch is saved with the show.

Do the same the other way round in Resolume's MIDI preferences: switch the
LIGHT unit off there, for input and output, or Resolume paints its clips onto
LIGHT's pads. Both units are bus-powered, so use a powered hub.

### Suggested starter layout (pad + fader controller)

| Control | Map to |
|---|---|
| 8 pads, top row | Columns 1–8 |
| Pads, second row | STROBE layer cells (flash looks — hold to hit) |
| Fader 1 | Grand master |
| Fader 2 | WASH layer master |
| Fader 3 | FX layer master |
| Fader 4 | Haze |
| Encoder / fader 5 | Effect speed |
| A spare pad | Tap tempo |
| A guarded pad | Blackout |

Map it once with learn; it saves with the project.
