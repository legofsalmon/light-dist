# Looks, pads and songs

## The grid

Rows are layers, columns are the sections of the song. In the demo show the
columns are Intro, Build, Break, Drop, Bridge, Peak, Outro, Blackout — name them
after your own arrangement; they are per-song.

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Fire a look | Click the pad |
| Select without firing | Click the pad's **name strip** |
| Fire a whole column as a cue | Click the column header, or keys `1`–`9` |
| Hold a flash look | Press and hold; it releases on mouse-up |
| Clear a layer | `✕` in the layer head |
| Rename or bypass a layer | Click the layer's name (hold on glass) and pick from its chooser |
| Rename / insert / delete a column | **Right-click** the column header |

Column editing is on right-click on purpose: left-click fires the column, and
editing must not be reachable by the gesture that triggers cues.

**A column is a cue.** Firing it fires every layer's pad in that column and
clears the layers whose pad is empty — so a column is a complete description of
the stage, not a set of additions. Momentary flash looks are skipped by cues,
deliberately: a cue can never latch a blinder on.

An empty pad is also where you *start* a look, so clicking one does not black
out a layer that is currently running. It selects, and offers to create. The
deliberate stop is the `✕` on the layer head.

## Layers

Each layer has a master and a blend mode, and they merge bottom to top:

- **replaces** — replaces what is below on the channels the look touches. For base
  washes.
- **dims** — scales the intensity below it. This is what an FX layer wants:
  a chase or a pulse that carves whatever colour the wash is showing, without
  owning colour itself.
- **brightest** — the brighter of the two layers wins. For strobes and blinders that sit on top
  and must never *remove* light.

Blend affects intensity only. Colour, position, strobe and colour slots always take
the upper layer's value — worth knowing, because "multiply" reads like it should
multiply colours and it does not. The one look the blend does not reach is a
**modifier look** — it shapes what is under it the same way on any row; see
[Modifier looks](04-effects.md#modifier-looks).

Click a layer's name to open its chooser: the blend, **Rename…** (the head
reads `L1` to `L4` until a layer has a name of its own), and **bypass**. A
locked client's chooser holds bypass alone — a performing move — and no edits.

**Bypass** is Arena's layer B. The layer goes silent instantly and comes
straight back; its pad keeps playing the whole time — live look, crossfade,
column and held flash untouched — so a row can be taken out under pressure
without losing what was on it, and un-bypassing returns the exact frame the
row would have been showing. The head reads `bypassed` in amber; click the
word, or the chooser's **bring back**, to return the row. On the phone the
row's number turns amber and a tap on it brings the row back; and every
bypassed row is listed in the **held** chip, on every page, with a `bring
back` beside it. The row's `✕`, a column and a flash release leave it alone;
ALL STOP and opening another show clear it. Never saved.

## Songs

The chips under the top bar are pages of the grid. Click to switch, double-click
to rename, `⧉ duplicate` copies the current song's pads into a new one — the
usual way to start the next song. `[` and `]` step through them, as do the
APC40's bank arrows.

Switching is held for a moment on click so that starting a rename does not
switch the show underneath you. The eyes-off paths — the bank arrows and the
bracket keys — are instant.

## What a look is made of

A look is a list of **parts**. Each part points at one fixture group and carries:

- **Dimmer** — intensity.
- **Colour** — hue and saturation faders, twelve swatches, and the colour chip
  at the end of the row, which opens the **picker**: a disc where the angle is
  hue and the distance from the middle is saturation, so "a bit more amber than
  that" is one move rather than two. It carries a hex field (brightness is
  ignored — intensity is the dimmer's job) and a warm-to-cool row of tints at
  the saturations a white actually reads at on a rig. Arrow keys walk the disc.
  Everything it sets goes out the same way a swatch does, so a colour you are
  nudging stays nudged. Fixtures that cannot mix colour quantise to their
  nearest fixed colour slot.
- **White** — the dedicated white emitter on an RGBW head. Offered when
  something in the group actually drives one.
- **Position** — pan and tilt, offered when something in the group has the
  channels for it.
- **Beam** — zoom, focus, beam size, soften, warmth. Warmth reads in **Kelvin**
  where the fixture's own definition states its range and every fixture in the
  group agrees on it; otherwise it stays a percentage rather than inventing a
  number. Each offered only if a fixture in
  the group has it. Absent means the look says nothing about that parameter and
  the fixture keeps whatever its profile parks it at — not that it is zero.
- **Gobo** and **prism** — a slot picker built from the fixture's own wheel
  (0 is open), and a *spin* fader where the wheel rotates. A slot is an index,
  not a DMX value, so one look lands on "the second gobo" of every fixture in
  the group, whatever make they are. *Not set* leaves the wheel where the
  fixture parks it, like the beam parameters. The spin fader's middle is
  stopped on most heads; either end is full speed one way.
- **Strobe** — the rate, plus the pattern where the fixture has one: plain,
  *pulse* (each flash ramps open and shut) or *random*. A fixture without the
  pattern strobes plain, so a pattern can never silence a head.
- The derby-specific ring controls where they apply.

Enable a parameter with the checkbox beside it. A look only writes the
parameters it has enabled, which is what lets layers combine cleanly: a colour
look and a position look can live on different layers without fighting.

> If a control you expect is missing, the group has no fixture that takes it.
> Where the *profile* lists the channel but drives nothing — which happens with
> definitions pulled out of an MVR — the editor says so and points at the fix.
> See [Patching](06-patch.md).

## Fades

Each layer has a default fade; a look can override it with its own. Colours fade
through RGB, intensities fade linearly, and *banded* values — colour slots,
motor modes — snap at the start of the fade, because the hardware cannot cross
between bands.

## Flash looks

Mark a look **FLASH** and it becomes momentary: active only while the pad or the
mapped MIDI note is held. If the client holding one disconnects, the engine
releases it rather than leaving a blinder on.

## Steps

Any look can become a chaser. Open it, press `⛓ steps`, and add steps — each
a look and a beat count. It hard-cuts through them on the beat, loops, and
follows the speed master. Steps cannot nest.

A look with steps is anchored at the moment you fire it, so a chase started on the
downbeat stays on the downbeat.

## Editing while the show runs

Dropping a look onto a pad that is **currently playing** does not change the
stage. The engine keeps playing the look it captured when you fired it, so a
build-ahead edit cannot change what the audience is looking at. The pad turns
amber to say the two disagree, and firing it again swaps to the new look.
