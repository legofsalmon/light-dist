# Tempo, MIDI and Resolume

## The beat clock

Everything time-based follows it: effect rates in beats, fades measured in
beats, steps.

- **TAP** (or `T`) — tap the tempo. Every tap also lands the downbeat.
- Drag the BPM number vertically for fine adjustment.
- **SYNC** makes the moment you press it the top of a bar — the bar count and every effect cycle restart there. Arena's own resync over OSC does the same.
- **LINK** joins an Ableton Link session and shows the peer count. Tapping in
  LIGHT leads the session. Not in 1.0.0 builds, pending Ableton's Link
  licence: there the switch is greyed out and says so.

Because rates are musical, changing tempo moves the whole rig in time without
any effect jumping phase.

## Resolume, over OSC

Enable OSC in the Sync · MIDI tab and point Arena at the port. Two things then
work on their own:

- **follow columns** — a column launch in Arena fires the matching cue in LIGHT.
- **bpm from resolume** — Arena's tempo and downbeat drive the clock instead of
  the tap.

There is a live monitor of incoming OSC in the same tab, which is the fastest
way to find out whether Arena is actually sending what you think.

## MIDI learn

1. Click **MIDI LEARN** in the top bar.
2. Click the thing you want to control — a pad, a column header, a layer master,
   a control's fader, blackout.
3. Touch the control on your device.

Notes fire pads and release flash looks on note-off. CCs drive faders. Mappings
are stored in the project, and the Sync · MIDI tab lists them for editing or
deletion.

## The APC40 mk2

There is a preset. It maps:

- the **top four pad rows** to the four layer rows of the grid, with matching
  colours on the pads;
- the **eight device knobs** to the eight dials, bound across all nine
  track-selection banks so a stray track button cannot unbind them;
- **scene buttons** to layer clears, **STOP ALL CLIPS** to blackout,
  **TAP TEMPO** to tap, the **bank arrows** to previous/next song;
- **track faders** to layer masters, then haze and effect speed, and the
  **master fader** to grand master.

The bottom pad row is deliberately left unmapped: it is the control row on
screen, and a pad cannot drive a continuous dial in both directions.

The pad LEDs mirror the grid — bright is what the layer is playing, dim is
available, coloured by each look's own swatch. A pad in the live column that no
longer holds the playing look keeps reporting the **stage**, not the pad, so the
surface never says "idle" about a layer that is lighting the room.

## The APC mini mk2

Also presetted, with a smaller layout: four pad rows for layers, the bottom row
firing columns, scene buttons for clears, tap and blackout.
