# LIGHT — documentation set

Source for the public documentation. Each file is one page; they are written to
be read in order but each stands alone.

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [01 · Overview](01-overview.md) | What LIGHT is, the mental model, how a frame is built |
| [02 · The console](02-console.md) | The four views, the panels, what collapses where |
| [03 · Looks, pads and songs](03-looks.md) | The grid, songs, looks, parts, steps, flash |
| [04 · Effects and fans](04-effects.md) | Waves, rate and depth, and how a phase fans across a group |
| [05 · Dials and pulses](05-controls.md) | Dials, pulses, and nudging a show live |
| [06 · Patching and fixtures](06-patch.md) | Addresses, profiles, GDTF and MVR import, groups, pixel layouts |
| [07 · Stage](07-previz.md) | The 3D stage, the 2D plan, the audition pane, the native window |
| [08 · Tempo, MIDI and Resolume](08-sync.md) | The beat clock, the APC40, OSC, Ableton Link |
| [09 · Output and safety](09-output.md) | Universes, Art-Net and sACN, masters, blackout, ALL STOP |
| [10 · Reference](10-reference.md) | Keyboard, glossary, where files live |

## Illustrations

`img/` holds what this set uses. All of it is real output from the demo show
except the two diagrams, which are authored — they explain structure better than
a screenshot of the same thing would.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `hero.jpg` | the Peak cue on the demo rig, front-page shot |
| `previz-3d.jpg` | the Drop cue — a plain shot of the 3D view, for the stage page |
| `signal-flow.svg` | how one frame is built — diagram |
| `console-layout.svg` | the pads view, annotated — diagram |
| `fan-sweep.gif` / `.mp4` | a hue spread sweeping the rig, captured from the 3D stage |
| `fan-still.jpg` | a single frame of the spread, for pages that want a still |
| `plan-view.jpg` | the 2D plan of the 129-fixture rig |

### Capturing more

The 2D plan is an ordinary canvas and can be read straight off the page. The 3D
stage view cannot: three.js runs with `preserveDrawingBuffer: false`, so
`toDataURL` returns an empty buffer. To capture it, turn that flag on
temporarily in `ui/src/components/Previz3D.tsx` (there is a comment at the
renderer marking the spot), **full-reload the page** — HMR keeps the old
renderer instance — shoot, then turn it back off. It costs a per-frame copy, so
it must not ship enabled.

Frames come out of the page as base64; `ffmpeg` turns a numbered sequence into
both a GIF and an MP4:

```bash
ffmpeg -framerate 8 -i f%03d.jpg   -vf "scale=560:-2,split[a][b];[a]palettegen=max_colors=96[p];[b][p]paletteuse" out.gif
```

Two things learned the hard way. The previz camera is persisted in
`localStorage` under `previz3d.camera` (`{pos:[x,y,z], target:[x,y,z]}`), so a
known-good pose can be written directly rather than orbited to — but note the
controls overwrite it as soon as anything drags, so set it and shoot without
touching the view.

And composition matters more than exposure now. The tone curve (Khronos PBR
Neutral — not a filmic one; it holds saturation where ACES washes a hot beam
toward white) rolls the highlights off instead of clipping them, and `auto exp`
(on by default) meters the frame, so even a full-blast look photographs with
structure and colour in it. Leave both alone unless you are deliberately
shooting the blown-out version.

Three things still help. Keep the camera out in the room rather than under the
rig. Remember the exposure takes about a second to settle after a cue change,
so shoot a beat late. And pick a cue whose light is SPREAD: the meter reads the
light leaving the rig, not the light reaching the lens, so a look that converges
48 washes on one spot still blows its middle — a beam cue photographs better
than a full wash, and the hue spread photographs best cropped to the truss line
where the cones are still separate.

Still wanted. All of what is left is **window**-level rather than canvas-level:
the stage view can be read out of the page with `toDataURL`, the rest of the console
cannot, so these want a real screenshot at full resolution.

1. **Pads view, whole window**, a cue live — for 02.
2. **A look open in the editor**, a part expanded with colour, position and an
   effect row — for 03.
3. **The control row** with a dial being moved and the NUDGED chip appearing —
   for 05.
4. **Fixtures table** with a fixture selected and its row highlighted in the plan —
   for 06.
5. **APC40** photographed with the grid lit, if the hardware is to hand — for 08.

## House style

Write for someone who runs shows and has used other consoles, not for someone
learning what a dimmer is. Say what a control does, then what it costs. Where
behaviour is surprising, say why it is that way — most of the surprises here are
deliberate, and the reason is usually "so it cannot ruin a show".
