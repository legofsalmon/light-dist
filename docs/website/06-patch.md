# Patching and fixtures

The **Rig** view (`⌥3`) puts the 2D plan over the fixtures table, because
patching is drag-a-row-into-the-plan and the two have to share a screen.

## The table

One row per fixture: name, profile, universe, address, and its position and aim
in the room.

- Number fields accept typed values including negatives, or **drag left/right on
  the field to scrub**.
- Select rows first — click, ⇧-click for a range, ⌘-click to toggle, or drag a
  box — and any edit applies to the whole selection.
- With rows selected the toolbar offers `→ universe`, `⇢ re-address`,
  `⧉ duplicate`, `✕ delete` and `⊕ group from N selected`.

Address conflicts are flagged in the table. A fixture whose profile is missing
is marked as well: it renders as nothing at all until you give it one.

## Position and aim

`Rot°` is yaw, `Tilt°` the mounting pitch, `Roll°` the roll. They compose on top
of each fixture type's default aim, so a bar hung at an angle points where it
actually points — and the stage and every position effect agree with the rig.

In the **2D plan**, drag a fixture to place it; `⌥`-drag rotates. Drag near a
truss bar with `snap` on and it clamps onto the bar and rigs there, so moving
the bar later moves everything on it. The **Front** elevation is the same view
from the side, where a drag sets *hang height* rather than position.

### Base aim

`Aim pan` and `Aim tilt` are where a moving head points when a look says
nothing — its **focus**. A look's pan and tilt then apply as a delta from
centre on top of it, so a rig focused head by head keeps that focus while looks
move around it. Fifty percent is centre and is also the default, so an
untouched head is stored with no aim at all.

The angle beside each one is the same number read against the fixture's own
travel, taken from its definition rather than assumed: 60% of a 540° pan is
54°, and 60% of a Nero's 180° tilt is 18°. Both stage views use the same
figures, so a head that swings 220° is no longer drawn as though it swung 270°.

### Calibration

`Cal` is how a head is **wired**, not where it points — the base aim stays
exactly where you focused it when any of this changes.

- **pan runs backwards** / **tilt runs backwards** mirror a look's movement on
  that axis. The head stays where it was focused and only the movement flips,
  so one head hung facing upstage can sweep with the rest instead of against
  them.
- **hung on its side** swaps pan and tilt, for a head rigged on its side.
  Applied before the inversions, which name the fixture's own axes.
- **limits** are a percentage of travel, and the head may not be driven outside
  them whatever a look or an effect asks for. This is the head that must not
  sweep into the video wall, or down into the front row.

Nothing here is on by default, and a fixture with no corrections renders
exactly as it did before any of it existed.

**Mounting rotation is still not compensated on the wire.** `Rot°` tells the
stage view which way the box faces; it does not change which way the head pans
for a given DMX value. If a head sweeps the wrong way, say so with **pan runs
backwards** — that reaches the rig and the stage view together.

## Groups

A group is a named set of heads, and groups are what looks point at. Their
**order is chase order** — the sequence a chase or a spread in patch `order` runs
through — so it is worth arranging.

`⟳` generates groups automatically: one per fixture type, one per truss bar.
Promote one to a hand-made group and regeneration leaves it alone.

## Profiles

A profile describes how a fixture's channels work: which offset is dimmer, how
the colour is mixed, what parks where. LIGHT ships profiles for the fixtures it
was built against and imports the rest from **GDTF**.

### Importing GDTF

Import a `.gdtf` and every DMX mode inside it becomes a profile you can select
in the table. The importer maps the standard attributes — dimmer, pan/tilt,
RGB/W, shutter with its pulse and random bands, the beam parameters zoom, focus,
beam size, soften and warmth, and one gobo wheel and one prism wheel (slot select
and rotation; where a fixture has two of a kind, the one that rotates) — onto the
parameters the look editor offers. A channel's resting value is what its
`InitialFunction` names, so a shutter that lists *closed* before *open* still
rests open.

Attributes are matched including their indexed spellings: GDTF writes `Dimmer`
on a single-instance geometry and `Dimmer1`, `Dimmer2` … when it is indexed, and
both count. This matters more than it sounds: an unmatched attribute compiles to
a channel that drives *nothing*, which is a fixture that never lights and never
says why.

Pixel geometry is read out of the file where it exists, so a multi-pixel fixture
arrives with its real layout and `row`/`col` fans work immediately.

### Importing MVR

An MVR brings a whole scene: fixtures, addresses, positions and the GDTF
definitions embedded in it. It is the fastest way to get a designer's plot into
LIGHT.

Be careful with what comes out the other side. MVRs are frequently exported by a
console that writes **flat, minimal fixture definitions** — a name, a channel
count, and nothing that drives anything. LIGHT flags those:

- **Placeholder profile** — a definition with essentially only dimmers behind it.
  It works as a dimmer and does nothing else.
- **Undriven beam channels** — the profile lists zoom, focus, beam size, soften or warmth
  by name but has no function behind them, so the look editor cannot offer those
  controls. The look editor says so where the faders would be.
- **An older importer** — every profile carries the version of the importer that
  compiled it, and one behind this build is flagged the same way: gobo, prism and
  shutter-pattern controls arrived with version 1, so a fixture imported before
  that has the channels and nothing behind them until it is rebuilt. **GDTF
  Share ▸ rebuild from library** re-imports every file in the fixture library.

The fix for both is the same: fetch the real definition from **GDTF Share** (or
the manufacturer) and re-import it, then point the fixtures at the new profile.

### The profiles a show carries

A show stores its compiled profiles, which is what lets it open on a machine
that has never seen the fixture. The **Profiles** table lists them with their
channel count, head count and how many fixtures point at each.

- **Rename** any of the three name fields. That is what the fixture dropdowns
  show; the channels, and therefore every byte on the wire, are untouched.
  Imported names are often unreadable, and this is where to fix that.
- **Remove** one nothing points at. Profiles used to accumulate with no way to
  take any out, so a show that had been through a few fixtures carried
  definitions nothing had used for months. Removal is refused while a fixture
  still uses it — those fixtures would render as nothing at all — and the
  `.gdtf` stays in the fixture library either way, so it can be imported again.

**One unreadable profile no longer costs you the show.** A profile the engine
cannot parse — hand-edited, or written by a newer build that knows something
this one does not — is skipped, and the fixtures using it show as having a
missing profile. It used to fail the whole project load, and the engine then
started from the demo show and renamed your file.

### Re-importing

Re-importing a corrected file **replaces** the stored profile, which rewrites
what every patched address means — correct, and the whole point, but never
silent: the app announces what changed. A layout you have hand-edited is kept if
the incoming file has nothing better to say about it.

Profiles are compiled into the project file and travel with the show. That is
also why they can go stale: a profile imported a year ago stays exactly as it
was compiled then. If controls are missing that the fixture obviously has,
re-import it.

## Pixel layouts

Multi-head fixtures carry a pixel layout — where each emitter physically sits.
The layout editor offers **strip**, **grid** (wired serpentine, as real matrix
panels are) and **ring**, and writes the result onto the profile so every
fixture using it inherits the positions.

The layout is what `row`/`col` spreads and the stage read, so getting it right
once makes every pixel effect behave on every fixture of that type.
